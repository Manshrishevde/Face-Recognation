# Face-Recognation
This project, "Face Recognition System", was developed under the guidance of Astha Sinha Madam. The system identifies and recognizes faces in images or video feeds based on pre-trained models and advanced computer vision techniques.

Project Overview :
The goal of this project is to build a robust face recognition system using a cleaned and preprocessed face dataset. The system leverages advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and recognize faces.

Features
Face Detection: Identify and localize faces in images or video streams.
Face Recognition: Match detected faces with pre-existing records or databases.
Model Training: Train recognition models using pre-labeled datasets.
Real-time Processing: Process video feeds to recognize faces in real time.
Data Preprocessing: Handle variations in lighting, pose, and image quality.
Evaluation: Measure accuracy using standard evaluation metrics.

Dataset
Source:  available face datasets 
Description: The dataset contains labeled images of faces, including variations in expressions, angles, and lighting.
Data Cleaning:
Removal of noisy or duplicate images.
Standardization of image sizes.
Handling class imbalances through augmentation techniques.

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Resize and normalize images.
Augment data (rotation, flipping, cropping) to improve robustness.
Align faces using key landmarks to standardize orientation.
2. Feature Extraction
Extract relevant features from images using:

Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG).
Deep learning embeddings from pre-trained models like FaceNet, VGGFace, or ResNet.
3. Face Detection
Detect faces using:
Haar Cascades.
Deep learning-based methods (e.g., MTCNN or SSD).
4. Face Recognition
Match extracted features to known identities using:
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Deep learning models for embedding matching.
5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate performance using:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).
ROC curves for threshold tuning.

Implementation
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch, dlib, matplotlib, scikit-learn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
Preprocessing Steps
Convert images to grayscale (if required).
Detect and crop face regions.
Normalize pixel values to improve model performance.

Future Work
Integrate real-time face recognition into video feeds (e.g., CCTV or webcam).
Incorporate emotion recognition along with face identification.
Explore advanced architectures such as Siamese networks or Transformers for face matching.
Develop a web or mobile-based interface for deploying the face recognition system.
Implement privacy-preserving techniques to protect user data.
